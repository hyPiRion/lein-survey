Part of the challenge with this question is determining whether low
usage of a feature is caused by low demand for it or just a lack of
knowledge about it. For instance, it's easy to overlook shell
wrappers, and very easy to miss out on the trampoline task. The javac
task is used surprisingly often; apparently projects that carry legacy
code with them are pretty common. I'm curious with the clean task
whether people use it because they know they need it or if they just
reach for it as a first instinct when things go wrong. I'd love to see
more people using test selectors; those can be very handy to organize
larger test suites.
