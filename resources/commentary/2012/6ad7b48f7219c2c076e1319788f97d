Startup time dominates here, as expected. Docs aren't too much of an
issue, though docs for end users appear to be better than the docs for
extending Leiningen itself. People seem to be pretty satisfied with
plugin selection. ClojureScript is an issue, but the recent official
release will help here, as well as progress on the lein-cljsbuild
plugin. Finding dependencies is also tricky. Hopefully some of the
data from ClojureSphere can be fed back into Clojars to help make this
clearer.
