<h4>Other Comments Summarized</h4>

<p>Lots of people want the features in Leiningen 2. Some are
  asking for stuff that's already been implemented in the master
  branch, so that makes me think we're on the right track.</p>

<blockquote>I still think lein-multi should be rolled into core so people can be
  encouraged to test cross-version.</blockquote>

<p>This is done; profiles in Leiningen 2 replace lein-multi in a much
  more flexible way.</p>

<blockquote>I dislike having to rename README to README.md each time after doing
  lein new.</blockquote>

<p>The <tt>lein new</tt> task in 2.0 supports flexible templates for
  project skeletons, (the default emits README.md) and best of all
  it's <a href="https://github.com/Raynes/lein-newnew">usable from
  Leiningen 1 as well</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Please copy cake's approach to managing conflicts in clojure version
  dependencies.  "lein deps" brings down two versions of clojure for a
  web app that I'm working on, while "cake deps" doesn't.</blockquote>

<p>We're also splitting <tt>:dev-dependencies</tt> into two separate
  lists, <tt>:plugins</tt> that run in Leiningen's process and
  profile-scoped dependencies for dev-time dependencies that run
  inside the actual project. This will take care of de-duplication,
  which has always been a problem with plugins that aren't careful
  about their dependency lists.</p>

<blockquote>I hope 2.0 will be backwards-compatible for end users of 1.6 (not
  plugin developers).</blockquote>

<p>I've tried to avoid gratuitous breakage, but there are some things
  that are unavoidable. My hope is to offer a <tt>lein precate</tt>
  plugin (the opposite of deprecate, of course) that can suggest
  changes to your project.clj file to bring it in line with version
  2.</p>

<p>I was not at all surprised to find startup time mentioned quite a
  few times. The upcoming 1.7.0 release uses tiered compilation to
  allow for quicker JVM startup on newer 64-bit JVMs; simple tasks can
  complete in around a second even without an SSD. Still not great,
  but a big improvement in some cases.</p>

<p>And then there were plenty of generally positive comments. A few of
  my favourites:</p>

<blockquote>The only criticism is that lein clearly insulates me from all sorts of
  Java nastiness, and that's probably bad for my moral fibre.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I come from a maven background and resisted using leiningen for
  a while. I was an idiot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Helped me convince my team to use Clojure over Scala.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Writing a plugin was easier and more enjoyable than I expected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I wonder what my girlfriend would think of a red heart with a blue
  arrow and "Leiningen forever!" underneath?</blockquote>

<p>It's always encouraging to hear things like that, so thanks!</p>

<blockquote>Leiningen is great, it just needs more documentation love
  and more refinements for complex/multi-module builds, startup time,
  Java-compilation (and JVM langs compilation via plugins) and so
  on.</blockquote>

<p>Definitely interested in getting feedback from folks with
  complicated builds. I
  think <a href="https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-sub">lein-sub</a>
  has potential to help make larger projects more manageable by
  allowing you to break them down into multiple smaller projects, but
  larger projects often have unique requirements. And of course,
  plugins that target other JVM languages are only going to happen if
  users of those languages step up.</p>

<blockquote>Having used build scripts, make, rake, sbt and leiningen, I'd say
  leiningen ranks far above the non-make crowd. (sorry. Make rules.)</blockquote>

<p>Apparently there are people who like <tt>make</tt>! I did not know this.</p>

<blockquote>One (very) minor annoyance with the docs was figuring out
  checkout dependencies. It wasn't clear at first whether I needed to
  change project.clj for either the main project or the checkout, and
  whether the checkout would take precedence over libs from remote
  repos.</blockquote>

<p>I've noticed again and again that checkout dependencies confuse a
  lot of people, but I have yet to figure out why or how they could be
  explained more clearly.</p>

<blockquote>One area that I am interested in is managing and packaging
  generic and non generic clojure code - for jvm/cljs/clr
  effectively.</blockquote>

<p>This is definitely an open question, and I think to an extent time
  will tell how this will shake out. At some point we'll probably have
  whole libraries that can run on the various runtimes, and having
  subsets of a project that can run in Javascript or the JVM is
  actually already possible with
  the <a href="http://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild">lein-cljsbuild</a>
  plugin. But only experience will tell us what works here.</p>
