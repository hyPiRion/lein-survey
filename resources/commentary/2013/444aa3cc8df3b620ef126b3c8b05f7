Startup time has always been the number one complaint about Leiningen, and the results reflect that. There are <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Faster">a number of tricks which can speed up boot</a>, but most of them remain fairly experimental. Hopefully we see some progress on those fronts in the upcoming months. I'm glad to see that people unsatisfied with Leiningen's end-user documentation remain a small minority (11%) though unfortunately they neglected to be specific about what it was they found lacking in the comments. For the lack of attention that's gone into native dependencies, it's not a major pain point for many either, though when it is a problem I suspect it's a big one. Only 10% report having a hard time finding dependencies, which has been a problem in the past. Documentation on plugins is weaker; this is a place where people are forced to fall back to IRC. Plugin coverage seems really strong.
