This came up repeatedly under the free-form comments section too: I have a suspicion that most people who think they need to write a Leiningen plugin would actually be perfectly happy with an alias. Leiningen 2 introduced partially-applied aliases, which means you can create an alias to the <code>run</code> task which has some arguments (<code>-m my.namespace</code> typically) partially applied to the task function. As long as you don't need access to the project map itself, an in-project namespace can do the trick nearly every time. This is a topic that deserves more in-depth explanation, so I hope to write something up soon.
