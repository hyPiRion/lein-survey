It's difficult to compare this with last year's results since last year was a lot more granular. Nearly everyone (80%) uses Leiningen on Linux-based systems, while a majority also use it on Macs. Windows is up to 19%, which is a modest growth of 3%. Recently (since the survey opened) Leiningen gained the ability to do self-install on Windows without extra third-party downloads, so that may boost this number in the future.
