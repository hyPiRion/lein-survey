Obviously pure-clojure projects are the most popular, but surprisingly mixed Java/Clojure projects are used by a large minority; up from 20% to 40%. My impression was that including Java source only happened with legacy projects and that this would become less common as time went on, but clearly that isn't the case. Clojurescript is nearly as widely used as Java, which is surprising given that only 57% of users are working on web applications to begin with. There are even a few brave souls using Leiningen for pure-java projects and someone using it for a Scala or Groovy project.
