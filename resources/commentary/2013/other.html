<h4>Other Comments Summarized</h4>

<p>Lots of just generally positive comments here, so thanks everyone!
  You're the best. People love the logo, which of course I
  can't <a href="http://lorenbroach.com">take credit for</a>.</p>

<p>A few people mentioned the complexity of the internals, and I
  completely agree that there are a few places in which things have
  gotten out of hand. Nobody feels this more keenly than I do. The
  logic for merging profiles and applying middleware in particular is
  treacherously subtle. Luckily it's fairly isolated, so unless you're
  specifically touching profile logic you can ignore it, but profiles
  are a big part of what makes Leiningen flexible. In the back of my
  head I'm already planning what can be done for Leiningen 3, and
  rewriting profile logic is on the top of the list.</p>

<p>There were some complaints about Windows support, but recent
  patches (some mentioned above) from David Powell seem to go a fair
  ways towards addressing these. In particular the installation
  situation is a lot nicer in 2.1.</p>

<blockquote>I'm never quite sure what I need to do to successfully
  publish or use a SNAPSHOT release. I don't know how to force Leiningen
  to download a new version of a SNAPSHOT.</blockquote>

<p>You can do this with <code>lein -U deps</code>, which is an alias
  for <code>lein with-profiles update deps</code>, but this should
  probably be in the FAQ. There are a few features like this tucked
  away that are not very discoverable; it's difficult to know how to
  expose them.</p>

<blockquote>In desperate need of a proper release plugin.</blockquote>

<p>I'd punted on the automation of bumping version numbers since for a
  long time there was no way to read Clojure code in a way that
  preserved comments for round-tripping, but
  now <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/sjacket">that exists</a>, so
  no more excuses! This should probably begin life as a third-party
  plugin and get merged to Leiningen once it's polished and matured
  though.</p>

<p>There were some complaints about the difficulty of getting started
  with GPG, but Leiningen 2.1
  now <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/GPG.md">ships
  with a GPG guide</a> which should help a lot on that front.</p>

<blockquote>One thing that would be of interest to me, is a blog post
  or series on leiningen's internal design (if one doesn't already
  exist).</blockquote>

<p>Daniel Higginbotham has started a series on how Leiningen works
  starting
  with <a href="http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/how-clojure-babies-are-made-lein-run/">a
  post on lein run</a> and a follow-up
  on <a href="http://www.flyingmachinestudios.com/programming/lein-trampoline/">trampoline</a>
  that has done a great job covering tricky topics so far.</p>

<blockquote>Lein deps :tree should highlight conflicting
  dependencies.</blockquote>

<p>This can be done currently by
  the <a href="https://github.com/xeqi/lein-pedantic">lein-pedantic</a>
  plugin, but there's no reason it couldn't be included in Leiningen
  proper as it's handy for debugging.</a>

<blockquote>Other things that annoy me about leiningen is the lack of
  phases. Having to rerun prep tasks before each task can be slow
  [...] compiling with different profiles.</blockquote>

<p>There's <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/issues/468">an
    open issue for this</a>; I don't think Maven-style phases are the
    right solution here, but I agree that changing profiles shouldn't
    force you to re-compile everything. I think by
    isolating <code>:target-path</code> on a per-profile basis this
    could be avoided. I hope to include this in version 2.2.</p>

<blockquote>Don't know where to find all the plugins available and
  what functions they have.</blockquote>

<p>While it's not 100% complete, plugin authors are encouraged to add
  their plugins
  to <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Plugins">the
    plugins page of the wiki</a>, so that's a great place to start.</p>
