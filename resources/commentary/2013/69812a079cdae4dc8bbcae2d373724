Profiles are a new feature in Leinigen 2.x, and they seem to be very popular. Surprisingly the CLI repl remains more popular than editor integration; perhaps due to it being fairly foolproof to set up. I suspect aliases would be more widely used if they were more prominently documented. Native dependencies have 20%, which is quite high for a feature that's virtually undocumented and not used by hardly any of the main contributors.
