This is a new question, motivated partly by wondering how common JVMs which predate <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/forax/archive/2010/09/04/tiered-compilation">Tiered Compilation</a> are. Uptake of 1.7 is happening fairly rapidly, and the vast majority of 1.6 users have Tiered Compilation. This is great news since it gives Leiningen a pretty serious speed boost. Users on older JVMs will have to disable it manually by setting <code>LEIN_JVM_OPTS</code>.
