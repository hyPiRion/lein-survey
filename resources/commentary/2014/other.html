<h4>Other Comments Summarized</h4>

<p>Not a whole lot of suggestions were submitted. I feel like that
  might be a sign that Leiningen has matured a fair bit
  recently. There's not much missing for most people.</p>

<p>There were a few comments about how it's more cumbersome than it
  could be to publish and consume private dependencies. We've added
  documentation for how to deploy over <tt>scp</tt> in the latest
  release, so hopefully that simplifies things for users who already
  have servers set up. The existing infrastrucutre around SSH key
  pairs is much better than what we have for S3 buckets.</p>

<blockquote>I miss some functionality to have a task auto run if one
  of it's source files are changed.</blockquote>

<p>For a while, we had a number of plugins that rolled their own
  support for this, which was really unfortunate. But these days
  there's a plugin that provides a higher-order task for this so the
  auto-re-run functionality is decoupled from a specific task, which
  is great. We might consider including this in a future version of
  Leiningen to increase its visibility.</p>

<blockquote>Plugin and template authors are writing code that hijacks
 (or makes assumptions) about the operating context, yielding unstable
 and unpredictable results.  The simple answer is "don't use plugins,"
 except that's one of the major use-cases for leiningen to begin
 with.o</blockquote>

<p>Leiningen allows plugins to declare hooks and middleware (which you
  can disable) that can run arbitrary code even when their own plugin
  task isn't being invoked. Since the effects of these hooks are not
  transparent or obvious, they're intended as a measure of last resort
  to allow for workarounds in situations where the built-in extension
  mechanisms aren't cutting it, but it appears that some plugins are
  taking it beyond that, which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>Dependencies that include native code continue to be a weakness
  since no one on the Leiningen team actually uses them. Unless
  someone familiar with native libraries on the JVM steps up to
  help, this will likely continue.</p>

<blockquote>I think lein-exec is so useful, that it would nice to have
  it folded in to the 'core' functionality.</blockquote>

<p>This is basically already included as part of the run
  task. <kbd>lein run -m clojure.main -i /path/to/file.clj</kbd> will
  load it. Since aliases can be partially applied, you can shorten
  this too: <kbd>:aliases {"exec" ["run" "-m" "clojure.main" "-i"]}</kbd></p>

<blockquote>Leiningen has been the single most important tool for increasing
  Clojure adoption.</blockquote>

<p>Overall the feedback has been very positive, so thanks for being
  great users.</p>
