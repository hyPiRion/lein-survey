Obviously startup time continues to dominate here. If you're one of the many who indicated this was a problem but you haven't taken a look at <a href="http://leiningen.org/grench.html">Grenchman</a> yet, now would be a great time to do so; Grenchman allows you to keep a running JVM "hot" and simply connect to it from a fast-launching CLI program. Complaints about documentation are down, which is always encouraging to see, and nearly no one has a hard time finding plugins for their needs.

Two new options this year were 3rd and 4th place: "confusing profile logic" and "AOT issues". I feel that AOT problems can mostly be addressed by profile isolation; see <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/doc/FAQ.md">the end of the FAQ</a> for details. Unfortunately it's technically a breaking change, so we can't enable it by default until 3.0, but turning it on for your own projects will help you avoid most of the problems around AOT. Confusing profile logic is trickier; from what I can tell the problems are a mix of counter-intuitive behaviour around how profiles interact with direct project map manipulations (<tt>update-in</tt> etc.) and plugins that use middleware in unpredictable ways. If you're a plugin author, please think hard before using middleware; there's almost always a better solution for whatever you're trying to do.
