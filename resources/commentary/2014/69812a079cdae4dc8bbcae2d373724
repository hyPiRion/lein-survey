We've got a lot more people using aliases, which is great. It's not obvious to many that you can use them for partial application of tasks, which lets you express things in a very tidy way. <a href="http://leiningen.org/grench.html">Grenchman</a> hasn't caught on widely, probably because it's a bit difficult to explain and hasn't been promoted much. Use of custom profiles has risen significantly too, which seems to indicate better understanding of more advanced Leiningen features.
