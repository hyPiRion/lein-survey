I expected apt to have the lead here, but I didn't expect it to be
such a dramatic lead. Windows is a bit higher than I expected, though
the number on Windows alone is very small; most supplement it with a
linux-based system. Homebrew is the clear leader among Mac users, but
a surprising number somehow survive without a package manager at all.
